# go-gin
Hello, thank you for looking at this repository! It's just a simple Rest API that I created while learning the Go language.

# Instalation
First things first, you will need to have Go and Docker installed at you machine. Then use `docker-compose up` to create the database image.

Now, for running the api. Well, since I used [Wire](https://github.com/google/wire) the `go run main.go` command is not working. If you want to try the project you will need to build it with `go build` and then run the generated ***go-gin.exe***.
